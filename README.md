# Graph Machine Learning

This repository contains notebooks I have tried/tweaked to test different graph algorithms and graph machine learning techniques.

## Setup

Make sure you have `conda` (or `mamba`) installed. 

Run the following command to create the `graphml` environment.

```bash
mamba env create -f environment.yml
```

Activate the environment

```bash
mamba activate graphml
```
